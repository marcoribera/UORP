This is a pretty silly little script, but I think it adds a lot of atmosphere to the game when used.

As the title says, it's just a wave. When placed it will play the sound of crashing waves to anyone near enough to hear it. It's on a single timer, so it the impact on server performance shouldn't be too severe.

usage:


[add Wave <direction> [ <bool small> ]


e.g.

[add Wave North
[add Wave West true

Hope someone finds it useful.
