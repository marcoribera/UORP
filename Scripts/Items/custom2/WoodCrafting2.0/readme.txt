Purpose: 
 Woodcrafting is an additional crafting skill.
 Fishermen will now pull up driftwood at times. 
 A whittling knife is required to carve the driftwood into various objects.
 Fishing skill is required to be able to whittle. The statuettes take a high level of skill to be able to whittle.
 
 This craft is still rather rudimentary at this point in time but is open ended to enhancements.
