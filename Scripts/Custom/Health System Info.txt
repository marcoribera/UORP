WHAT IS THIS?

This is an RP Enhancement for your world. What this does is keep track of various ailments, diseases, and other conditions that can afflict a person. These can be displayed in a gump. The chance to be afflicted by contact or genetics, etc., is stored in a series of double values called Scalars. There is a gump for the Admin to modify the scalars to fit the shard.

WHAT IS THIS NOT?

This is NOT a way to inflict damage on people or cause pain (yet) as there is no mechanism to tie this into the existing scripts. (Of course, if you want to do that you probably can.)

INSTALLATION:

Drop in anywhere and restart. (No MODS necessary.)

USE:

Any player can view their own health by typing "[Health", and a GM can view anyone's health by typing "[ViewHealth". The Admin can adjust scalars by typing "[HealthScalar". There is currently no other use supported, but if you think about it, you could probably tie this system in with other systems like Food, Combat, etc.

MODIFICATIONS/UPDATES:

I will post updates here. I will also include any mods made by the community, and include separate attachments, if necessary.
